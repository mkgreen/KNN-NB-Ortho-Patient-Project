### Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,KNN,NB

**Project Objective:**  In this project, the data provided multiple instances of orthopedic parameters and their classification as either Normal or Abnormal. I implemented K Nearest Neighbor to classify and diagnose the patients.

**Quantifiable result:** Successfully classified the orthopedic parameters as either Normal or Abnormal with an accuracy of 82%.

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
