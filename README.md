### Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,KNN,NB

**Project Objective:** In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters and we are also provided with their classification as Normal or Abnormal. We have to implement K Nearest Neighbour, the algorithm is used to classify points according to class of their K nearest neighbour points .

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the orthopedic parameters as Normal or Abnormal with an accuracy of 82% .

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
